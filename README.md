Project Tips & Suggestions
For this project, plan to create breakpoints for content >767px and <768px


Creating a functional dashboard will require strong organizational skills. Be sure you appropriately organize your content and utilize comments often in both you html and css to provide structure as you work through it. Commit often!! Think about phases when commits should be made (locally) - after setup, after the HTML markup has been structured, and other significant milestones - no more "I had it this way at first!" If it was there it should be in a previous commit.

The header should be a fixed position element. Its width will be 220px and its height equal to the viewport height (100vh). In case its contents exceed the viewport height, a vertical scrollbar will appear. The nav element can behave as a flex container with a minimum height of 100%.

Once you've marked up your entire project, try to hide the verticle menu on smaller screens!
